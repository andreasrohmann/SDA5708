# SDA5708 Arduino Library

The company Siemens produced these tiny 8 character 5x7 dot matrix displays. They were widely used in some Nokia Receivers like the DBOX1 in Germany. I don't know if there are other sources but as I have so many of these displays I decided to make an Arduino Library to easily use them in small projects.

With this library you can use the dot matrix display similar to LCD Displays. Either multiple independant displays with multiple instances of the class or multiple displays combined together with 16, 24, 32, ... characters in a row. 

Please refer to the documentation provided.
